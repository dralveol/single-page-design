## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- BEM

### What I learned

By diving into BEM, reading more about SASS, discovering libraries and what can be made with css. I feel like i'm starting to pass over the mountain of stupidity (Dunin Kruger Effect) and this is really good news.

I felt like the carousel part was really tricky. I don't know why if i don't set both html and body overflow to hidden. It just does not get hidden.


### Continued development

Design process +++++++.
More jQuery, SASS and BEM. Then move maybe to React.
